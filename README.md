## Goal

We will be creating an app that generates randomized passwords based on user input. The goal is to create a useful tool while simulating an environment where we can have hands-on experience working with programmers of different levels and debug code together. 

## Design

We have selected an intermediate-level challenge from FrontEndMentor and will be creating a password generator app based on a Figma sketch. 

## Technologies

The technologies used for this project are: 
* HTML
* CSS
* JavaScript

## Team

We are a team of aspiring developers working and learning together: 
* Aina
